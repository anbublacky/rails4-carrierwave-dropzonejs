This is a sample Ruby on Rails 4 application that
shows you how to integrate DropzoneJS and Carrierwave for seamless
multiple image uploads.

It has two models: `Product` and `Picture`

The meat of the application is in the `pictures_controller.rb`
and the `show.html.erb`.

Be sure to check out `application.js` as well for the DropzoneJS
configuration.
